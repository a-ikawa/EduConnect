# EduConnect
I am trying to create a social app to help teachers in communicating with students more often through text or video chat and allow teachers to provide students with individualized instruction and feedback. Some of the problems are lack of communication between teachers and students but also failure in recognizing student progress and not providing more individualized feedback and personalized content for students.
